    "Assuming you can trust what you read, there is an association between ice cream sales and violent crime. The fact that the two are related, however, does not necessarily mean one causes the other. It may be the case that increasing ice cream sales case ice cream shortages which instigate violent crimes as competition for ice cream skyrockets. However, it may also be the case that ice cream sales and violent crime are both caused by hot temperatures, as people try to eat more ice cream to cool their over-temped tempers. In this case, ice cream sales would not cause violent crime, even though they are associated. Careful and detailed study will be required to get to the bottom of this question of paramount importance.\n",

On the other hand, in an experiment the experimenters create a situation from which they collect and analyze data. This allows the experimenters to take extra steps to prevent confounding factors."
